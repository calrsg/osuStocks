# osu!Stocks
### A Discord bot interface for a global stock exchange based on osu! players!

osu!Stocks is a public stock exchange, where users can buy and sell stock in individual osu! players in a global marketplace, all through a public Discord bot.

## Usage

Nothing yet :)

## Planned Functionality

- List of top <x> osu! players, including a small summary of their current osu! profile, current stock price, and recent stock prices.
- Global leaderboard showing richest users.
- Daily and/or Weekly income for users to keep economy active (avoid users going broke).
- Player profiles including notable recent events, such as namechanges and recent top plays.
  
## Long Term

Generally, these are plans that are feasible and I'd like to implement, but currently don't know how.
  
- Generate graphs to show recent stock prices.
- Player profiles show recent tournament performances (would tie in to another project I have been planning).
